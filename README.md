# LTU-Kart

LTU-Kart is a web-based multiplayer racing game inspired by the Mario Kart series. It enables players to join a race by scanning a QR code, with no need for account registration or game installation. The game is built using Unity as game engine, Node.js for the backend, and WebSocket (Socket.IO) for real-time communication. It aims to provide a good gaming experience for players on mobile devices.

## Features
- Real-time multiplayer support via WebSockets
